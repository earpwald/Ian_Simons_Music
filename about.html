				<p>
					 The Mission Statement of the Band is J330. This comes from The Gospel of John in the New Testament of the Bible and is taken from John chapter 3 and verse 30. #39;He must become greater, I must become less#39;. When we read John's gospel chapter 3 verses 27 - 36, it puts our mission statement in context. Jesus Christ came to us from heaven and is the saviour of the world. Verse 35 tells us that God has placed everything in the hands of His Son - Jesus Christ. <br /><br />It is our desire to lead God's people in worship and praise of Jesus Christ. As we use the talents and gifts that God has blessed us with we want to see God's name lifted high. We only get in the way when we desire the praises of men - so help us to never get in the way!.

			<div class="well">
				<p>
 					Ian Simons and Band have evolved over the past few years and are now in a serious position to deliver on their promise - to lead God's people in worship and praise. The band now consists of many talented and very dedicated musicians and singers. The band is keen to play more often and so have responded positively to the numerous and varied requests to perform our own songs and lead congregations of people in worship and praise.<br /><br />

					There are quite a few people directly and indirectly involved with this music ministry.
 				</p>
 				<ul>
 					<li>Prayer support is the key to any effective christian ministry and being involved with music is no different. We rely on a number of key prayer supporters and are ever encouraged by their kind words and deeds.</li>
 					<li>Musicians form the main body of what we are about and it is essential that we continue to work hard to develop our skills and look for creative ways to write and perform our music.</li>
 					<li>We have a significant number of helpers when jobs need to be done and for that support and encouragement we are very thankful.</li>
 					<li>Our God and saviour Jesus Christ is the reason behind all that we do and it is important that we develop our relationship with Him through studying the scriptures, praying and sharing our faith with others.</li>
 				</ul>

			<div class="page-header"><h2>Future Plans</h2></div>
			<div class="well">
				<p>
					Our aim is to lead God's people in praise and worship of His glorious name. We believe that the whole church is important to God and for that reason we incorporate a selection of old and new songs in most of our repertoires. We have had many requests to play at secular events and to perform the music at wedding receptions. This may be another focus of our attention in 2014. Also during 2014 we have made difinite plans to compose new worship songs and produce the scores for congregations, groups and individuals to follow. Hopefully we can get a chance to teach these new songs to many people throughout the year.
